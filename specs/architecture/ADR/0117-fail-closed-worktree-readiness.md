# 117 - Fail-Closed Worktree Readiness

## Status

ACCEPTED — Supersedes the failure-handling decision of ADR-0031. The configuration
mechanism, trust model, and stack-agnostic constraint of ADR-0031 remain in force.

## Context and Problem Statement

ADR-0031 made worktree setup configurable via `post_worktree_cmd` and chose a
permissive failure strategy: "Failures produce warnings, never block task
claiming." The rationale was operational — let agents proceed and analyze logs
in batches.

A run on 2026-08-22 showed what that costs. The repository had no
`post_worktree_cmd` configured, and 45 provider sessions in a single day failed
on the same missing generated input (`pattern contracts/*.md: no matching files
found`) across coder, integration-analyst, code-plan-reviewer, code-planner, and
integration-reviewer roles. Agents spent turns rediscovering and repairing the
same prerequisite.

`daf90df7` addressed the missing-configuration half at init time. This ADR
addresses the second half: when a command *is* configured and fails, a warning in
a log nobody reads is indistinguishable from success. Worse, several provider
entry points never ran the command at all.

## Considered Options

1. **Keep warn-only, improve diagnostics** — the 2026-08-22 run is evidence that
   better warnings do not get read during a run.
2. **Fail closed, block the task on failure** — rejected for reviewers: see
   Decision.
3. **Fail closed, release and degrade** — chosen.

## Decision Outcome

A configured `post_worktree_cmd` must succeed before a provider session starts.

**Doer claim** (`claim_task.go`): the claim aborts in Phase 2, before Phase 3
commits any task or agent state, so no claim exists for a worktree that is not
build-ready. The worktree is left on disk so the failure can be reproduced
against it; a later fresh claim treats it as a stale resource.

**Doer resume** (`claiming.go`): `ResumeHandoff` and `ResumeOwnedTask` return
before `ClaimTask`, so they enforce setup themselves. Enforcement is not placed
in `doerStrategy.PreExecution` because the supervisor logs `PreExecution`
failures and continues; using that hook would not fail closed without changing
the error contract for every strategy, including the orchestrator.

**Reviewer sessions** (`worktree_check.go`, `strategy_reviewer.go`): the command
runs on both the recovery path and the intact-worktree path, because reviewers
build and test and need the checkout the doer had. On failure the reviewer claim
is **released** back to the task's reviewable status and the reviewer agent is
degraded.

Blocking the task was rejected. `unblock-task` restores a BLOCKED task to the
doer's executing status, which would discard completed, review-ready doer work
for an environment fault that left the worktree intact. `blockReviewerTask`
remains reserved for genuinely lost work (worktree and branch both missing).

**Retry is bounded** by classification: the failure is an infrastructure claim
error (`claim_worktree_setup_failed`), so the agent is marked degraded with a
recover hint naming the command and worktree, and the supervisor exits on
`ErrAgentDegraded` before building a prompt. Without this bound, failing closed
would produce a hot claim loop across every candidate task.

Degradation is owned by `ops.ClaimTask` rather than by the supervisor claim
loop, because that loop is not the only production caller: `await-verdict`
auto-reclaims a rejected task through the same function, and a per-caller bound
left that path retrying without one. Resume and reviewer paths bypass
`ClaimTask`, so they degrade explicitly at their own boundaries.

**The diagnostic is the command, the worktree, and the exit status — nothing
from the child process.** `RunPostWorktreeCmd` does not capture the command's
output at all, and `PostWorktreeSetupError` has no field for it.

This is a security decision, not a brevity one. Masking cannot cover the child.
`secretmask` is built from this process's environment and recognizes
credential-shaped key names (`API_KEY`, `*_TOKEN`, `*_SECRET`, `*_PASSWORD`, and
a fixed provider list). Worktree env files are copied in before setup runs, so a
command can source `.env` and print a value this process never saw — and a key
like `DATABASE_URL` matches none of those rules, so a masking-based defense would
pass a connection string containing a password straight through into agent logs.
Since no masking of child output is a guarantee, none is attempted and nothing is
captured. CORE.md's secret-handling rule (T0.5) covers logs, not just durable
state.

The command itself is operator-supplied configuration, so it is masked with the
parent environment and capped head-first at 256 bytes; with a
filesystem-bounded worktree path and a short exit status, the whole rendered
diagnostic is bounded. The operator reproduces the failure by rerunning the named
command in the named worktree, which the recover hint instructs.

**No opt-out.** A per-project "warn only" switch would reintroduce exactly the
silent mode this ADR removes.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- A setup failure surfaces as a named, actionable state instead of a log line.
- Review progress survives a setup failure; only the reviewer is degraded.
- Every provider entry point is covered, including resumes.

**Limitations accepted:**
- A flaky setup command now idles agents instead of producing unreliable work.
  Deliberate: a stalled run with a named cause is recoverable, output built on a
  broken environment is not.
- A failing worktree is left on disk with no task state referencing it until the
  next claim reclaims it as stale.
- The failing command's output is not shown anywhere. Diagnosing a setup failure
  requires rerunning the command in the worktree. Accepted as the price of a
  guarantee rather than a best-effort filter; it also removes the unbounded
  in-memory buffering that capturing output required.
